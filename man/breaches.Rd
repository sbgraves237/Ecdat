\title{ Cyber Security Breaches }
\description{
  \code{data.frame} of cyber security breaches 
  involving health care records of 500 or more 
  humans reported to the U.S. Department of 
  Health and Human Services (HHS) as of June 
  27, 2014.   
}
\usage{data(breaches)}
\format{
  A \code{data.frame} with 1055 observations on 
  the following 24 variables:
  \describe{
    \item{Number}{
      integer record number in the HHS data base 
    }
    \item{Name_of_Covered_Entity}{
      \code{\link{factor}} giving the name of the
      entity experiencing the breach 
    }
    \item{State}{
      Factor giving the 2-letter code of the state
      where the breach occurred.  This has 52 levels
      for the 50 states plus the District of Columbia 
      (DC) and Puerto Rico (PR).  
    }
    \item{Business_Associate_Involved}{
      Factor giving the name of a subcontractor (or
      blank) associated with the breach.  
    }     
    \item{Individuals_Affected}{
      \code{\link{integer}} number of humans whose
      records were compromised in the breach.  This
      is 500 or greater;  U.S. law requires reports
      of breaches involving 500 or more records but
      not of breaches involving fewer.  
    }
    \item{Date_of_Breach}{
      \code{\link{character}} vector giving the 
      date or date range of the breach.  Recodes 
      as \code{\link{Date}}s in \code{breach_start}
      and \code{breach_end}.  
    }
    \item{Type_of_Breach}{
      \code{\link{factor}} with 29 levels giving the
      type of breach (e.g., "Theft" vs.
      "Unauthorized Access/Disclosure", etc.)
    }
    \item{Location_of_Breached_Information}{ 
      \code{\link{factor}} with 41 levels coding the 
      location from which the breach occurred (e.g.,
      "Paper", "Laptop", etc.)
    }
    \item{Date_Posted_or_Updated}{
      \code{\link{Date}} the information was posted
      to the HHS data base or last updated.  
    }
    \item{Summary}{
      \code{\link{character}} vector of a summary of 
      the incident.  
    }
    \item{breach_start}{
      \code{\link{Date}} of the start of the 
      incident = first date given in
      \code{Date_of_Breach} above. 
    }
    \item{breach_end}{
      \code{\link{Date}} of the end of the incident
      or \code{NA} if only one date is given in 
      \code{Date_of_Breach} above.  
    }
    \item{year}{
      \code{\link{integer}} giving the year of the
      breach 
    }
  }
}
\details{
  The data primarily consists of breaches that
  occurred from 2010 through early 2014 when the
  extract was taken.  However, a few breaches are
  recorded including 1 from 1997, 8 from 2002-2007,
  13 from 2008 and 56 from 2009.  The numbers of
  breaches from 2010 - 2014 are 211, 229, 227, 
  254 and 56, respectively. (A chi-square test for
  equality of the counts from 2010 through 2013 is 
  4.11, which with 3 degrees of freedom has a
  significance probability of 0.25.  Thus, even
  though the lowest number is the first and the
  largest count is the last, the apparent trend is 
  not statistically significant under the usual
  assumption of independent Poisson trials.)
