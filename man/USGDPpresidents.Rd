  US GDP per capita with presidents and wars
}
\description{
  It is commonly claimed that Franklin Roosevelt 
  (FDR) did not end the Great Depression:  World 
  War II (WW2) did.  This is supported by the 10.6
  percent growth per year in real Gross Domestic
  Product (GDP) per capita seen in the standard 
  GDP estimates from 1940 to 1945.  It is also 
  supported by the rapid decline in unemployment
  during the war.  
  
  However, no comparable growth spurts in GDP per 
  capita catch the eye in a plot of 
  \code{log(GDP per capita)} from 1790 to 2015,
  whether associated with a war or not, using data
  from Measuring Worth.  The only other features 
  of that plot that seem visually comparable are 
  the economic disaster of Herbert Hoover's
  presidency (when GDP per capital fell by 10 
  percent per year, 1929-1932), the impressive 
  growth of the US economy during the first seven
  years of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (6.4
  percent per year, 1933-1940), and the post-World
  War II recession (when GDP per capita fell by 
  7.9 percent per year, 1945-1947).  (NOTE:  The 
  web site for Measuring Worth, 
  \code{https://measuringworth.com/} still works, 
  but has not always been maintained to current
  internet security standards.  Therefore, the 
  link is provided here in text but not as a link.)
  
  Closer inspection of this plot suggests that the 
  US economy has generally grown faster after FDR
  than before.  This might plausibly be attributed 
  to 
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes}{
  "The Keynesian Ascendancy 1939-1979"}.  
  
  Unemployment dropped during the First World War 
  as it did during WW2.  Comparable unemployment 
  data are not available for the U.S. during other
  major wars, most notably the 
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War}{American Civil War} and the 
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_War}{Mexican-American War}.  
  
  This data set provides a platform for testing 
  the effects of presidency, war, and Keynes.  It
  does this by combining the numbers for US
  population and real GDP per capital dollars from
  Measuring Worth with the presidency and a list 
  of major wars and an estimate of the battle
  deaths by year per million population.  (As 
  noted above, the web address for measuring worth, 
  \code{https://measuringworth.com/}, often gives 
  security warnings but still seems to provide the 
  data as before.)

      Numeric:  U. S. Consumer Price Index per

      Population figures for 1610 to 1780 came 
      from Springston (2013).  The rest came 
      from Johnston and Williamson.  (The

      the European settlers in the British 
      colonies that eventually became the 
      US.)

      through 1774, followed by the
      \code{"ContinentalCongress"} and the 
      \code{"ArticlesOfConfederation"} until
      Washington, who became President under the
      current base constitution in 1789.  Two
      nineteenth century presidents are not 
      listed here (William Henry Harrison and 
      James A. Garfield), because they died so 
      soon after inauguration that any 
      contribution they made to the economic 
      growth of the nation might seem too slight 
      to measure accurately in annual data like 
      this;  their contributions therefore 
      appear combined with their replacements 
      (John Tyler and Chester A. Arthur, 
      respectively).  The service of two other 
      presidents is officially combined here:  
      "Taylor-Fillmore" refers to the 16 months
      served by Zachary Taylor with the 32 months 
      of Millard Fillmore.  These modifications 
      make 
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama}{Barack Obama}
      number 41 on this list, even though he's 
      the 44th president of the U.S.  
    }
    \item{war}{
      \code{\link{ordered}}:  This lists the 
      major wars in US history by years 
      involving active hostilities.  A war is 
      "major" for present purposes if it met 
      two criteria:  
      
      (1) It averaged at least 10 battle deaths 
      per year per million US population.  
      
      (2) It was listed in one of two lists of 
      wars:  
      For wars since 1816, it must have appeared 
      in the 
      \href{https://correlatesofwar.org/}{Correlates of 
      War}.  For wars between 1790 and 1815, it 
      must have appeared in the Wikipedia 
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States}{
      "List of wars involving the United States"}.  
      
      The resulting list includes a few 
      adjustments to the list of wars that might 
      come readily to mind for people moderately
      familiar with US history.    
      
      A traditional list might start with the
      American Revolution, the War of 1812, the
      Mexican-American war, the Civil War, the
      Spanish-American war, World Wars I and II,
      Korea, and Vietnam.  In addition, the 
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War}{
      Northwest Indian War} involved very roughly 
      30 battle deaths per year per million
      population 1785-1795.  This compares with the
      roughly 100 battle deaths per year 1812-1815
      for the 
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812}{
      War of 1812}.  
      
      For present purposes, the Spanish-American 
      War is combined with the lesser-known 
      American-Philippine War:  The latter 
      involved 50 percent more battle deaths but 
      over a longer period of time and arguably 
      with less impact on the stature of the US as 
      a growing world power.  However, its 
      magnitude suggest it might have impacted the 
      US economy in a way roughly comparable to 
      the Spanish-American war.  The two are
      therefore listed here together as 
      "Spanish-American-Philippine" war.  
      
      \href{https://correlatesofwar.org/}{The Correlates of 
      War (COW)} data include multiple US uses 
      of military force  during the Vietnam War 
      era.  It starts with "Vietnam Phase 1", 
      1961-65, with 506 battle deaths in the COW 
      data base.  It includes the "Second 
      Laotian" war phases 1 and 2, plus 
      engagement with a "Communist Coalition" 
      and Khmer Rouge as well as actions in the
      Dominican Republic and Guatemala.  The 
      current \code{\link{data.frame}} includes 
      only "Vietnam", referring primarily to 
      COW's "Vietnam War, Phase 2", 1965-1973.  
      The associated battle deaths include 
      battle deaths from these other, lesser
      concurrent conflicts.  

      The COW data currently ends in 2007.  
      However, the post-2000 conflicts in 
      Afghanistan and Iraq averaged less than 
      1,000 battle deaths per year or roughly 3
      battle deaths per year per million population.
      This is below the threshold of 10 battle 
      deaths per year per million population.  
      This in turn suggests that any impact of 
      those conflicts on the US economy might be
      small and difficult to estimate.

      more accurate.  
    }
    \item{fedReceipts, fedOutlays, fedSurplus}{
      Receipts and Outlays of the US federal 
      government in millions of current dollars.  
      
      For data beginning with 1901, these are 
      from the US federal budget from The White 
      House (2022).  Earlier data are from 
      series Y 335-337 in US Census Bureau 
      (1975).  As of 2022-02-22 the data from 
      The White House included aggregations for 
      1789-1849 and 1850-1900, which matched 
      the totals of Y 335-337 for those two 
      sets of years.  The nuumbers from 1901 to 
      1933 are the same in both sources.  
      
      We used The White House (2022) for the more
      recent numbers with one exception:  Between 
      1976 and 1977 the fiscal year was changed 
      from starting July 1 to October 1.  July, 
      August, and September, 1976, is called the 
      "transitional quarter", and has been 
      deleted from this dataset.  
      
      NOTES: 
      
      The numbers for 1843 are for only the 
      first half of the year, January 1 through 
      June 30.  This explains why the numbers for 
      1843 are only roughly half of the 
      corresponding values for 1844 and 1845.  
      
      Also, the numbers for 1791 are actually for 
      1789-1791.  However, those numbers seem 
      comparable to those for 1792 and 1793, so
      it is listed as only for one year rather 
      than three.  
    }
    \item{fedDebt}{
      US federal government debt in millions of 
      current dollars per FiscalData (2022).  
      This matches Y 338 in United States 
      Census Bureau (1975) 1921-1939 but not 
      earlier, and Y 338 ends with 1939.  
      Between 1921 and 1939 these numbers are
      as of June 30.  Between 1843 and 1920 
      they are as of July 1.  The earlier 
      numbers are as of January 1.  
      
      FiscalData (2022) includes debt 
      for both January 1 (20 million) and 
      July 1 (33 million) for 1843.  For
      present purposes, we omit the 
      January 1 number.  This overstates
      the volatility of the national 
      debt during that period, showing 
      it rising from 14 million in 
      1842 (January 1) to 33 million 
      in 1843 (July 1), being 18 not 
      12 months.  The alternative would
      be to delete the 33 million, but 
      that would understate the volatility 
      of the debt during that period. 
    }
    \item{fedReceipts_pGDP, fedOutlays_pGDP, 
      fedSurplus_pGDP, fedDebt_pGDP}{
      numeric = \code{fedReceipts},

      were for only the first six months;  to 
      compute \code{*_pGDP} for these numbers 
      for 1843 only, the denominator in this 
      formula is cut in half to compensate.
