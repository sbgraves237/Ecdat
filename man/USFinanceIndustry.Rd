  This is extracted from Table 6.16 of the 
  National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) 
  compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
  of the United States federal government.  
  This table comes in four parts, A (1929-1947), 
  B (1948-1987), C (1987-2000), and D 
  (1998-present).  Parts A, B, C and D contain 
  different numbers of data elements, but the
  first five have the same names and are the 
  only ones used here.  The overlap between 
  parts C and D (1998-2000) have a root mean 
  square relative difference of 0.7 percent;  
  there were no differences between the numbers 
  in the overlap period between parts B and C 
  (1987).

  This was created using the following command:

  \code{demoDir <- system.file('demoFiles', package='Ecdat')}
  \code{demoCsv <- dir(demoDir, pattern='csv$', full.names=TRUE)}

  \code{nipa6.16 <- Ecfun::readNIPA(demoCsv)}
  \code{USFinanceIndustry <- as.data.frame(nipa6.16)}
  \code{names(USFinanceIndustry) <- c('year', 
    'CorporateProfitsAdj', 'Domestic', 'Financial', 
    'Nonfinancial', 'restOfWorld')}
  \code{USFinanceIndustry$FinanceProportion <- 
    with(USFinanceIndustry, Financial/Domestic)}
}
\source{
  \url{https://www.bea.gov}:  Under "U.S. Economic Accounts", first
  select "Corporate Profits" under "National".  Then next to
  "Interactive Tables", select, "National Income and Product Accounts
  Tables".  From there, select "Begin using the data...".  Under
  "Section 6 - income and employment by industry", select each of the
  tables starting "Table 6.16".  As of February 2013, there were 4 such
  tables available:  Table 6.16A, 6.16B, 6.16C and 6.16D.  Each of the
  last three are available in annual and quarterly summaries.  The
  \code{USFinanceIndustry} data combined the first 4 rows of the 4
  annual summary tables.
