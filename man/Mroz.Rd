\details{
  These data seem to have come from the same source 
  as \code{carData::Mroz}, though each data set has
  variables not in the other.  The variables that
  are shared have different names.  
  
  On 2019-11-04 Bruno Rodrigues explained that 
  \code{Ecdat::Mroz['work']} had the two labels 
  incorrectly swapped, and 
  \code{wooldridge::mroz['inlf']} was correct; 
  \code{wooldridge} matches 
  \code{carData::Mroz['lfp']}.
